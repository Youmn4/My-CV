Hello everyone! I am Youmna Ahmed Mohamed, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Pharos University in Alexandria.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.850
During my studies, I explored various fields such as Web Development and Human-Computer Interaction.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.830
I am fascinated by how technology simplifies our lives and how to build intelligent systems from scratch.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.140
I have worked on several projects across different disciplines.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.440
One of the most important is the Stopwatch project for the Digital System Design course, using 74xx ICs.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.110
This project taught me a lot about hardware debugging and how to transform logic gates into tangible work.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:50.000
On the software side, we developed a Rock Paper Scissors game for the OOP course using Java and Android Studio.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.580
We focused on implementing core OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.000
These concepts helped us write organized and reusable code.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.500
Overall, this project was very beneficial, teaching us how to create organized and scalable applications.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.180
I am currently working on improving my skills in programming languages like Java, C, and Python.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.410
I am also particularly interested in the web technologies you see in my CV right now.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.730
My current goal is to apply what I've learned in practical internships and contribute to real, large-scale projects.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.270
Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoyed my CV!
